# Tools Notes

## ec.sh

For this work properly, the following conventions should be met.

1. [OPTIONAL] The Emacs host's might have hostname *crystal-host* for one of its private
   network IPs (usually created by Virtualbox) that accessible from crystal
   box.

2. The Emacs server should have configured the server like the following:

  ```lisp
  (setq server-auth-key
        "mUN/:r=V}\\|1F]LjX6:fz|!_|a@-7mu^-U2xVv<?*4I:FrZj\"lTdl;G;Ox`A4G7L"
        server-port 57777
        server-host "crystal-host")
  ```

3. The default *all* samba share exported by the crystal box must be mapped to
   "O:" drive label. This is needed to have path map working.

4. PS: the format of server file is quite straightfoward.
   - 1st line is **IP Address** and PID of remote Emacs server instance, which can be
     a wildcard. Note the hostname is *not* supported and thus we should make
     sure *crystal-host* matches the *ip address*.
   - 2nd line is the auth key used by Emacs server, it's generated by
     `(server-generate-key)` if not set.
   - WARNING again: the whole Emacs server/client communication is *NOT*
     encrypted.
