# Personal utils

Catagorized under several classes.

## bin

In the PATH

My own scripts/compiled binaries, which I have written or significantly
modified to suit my needs, i.e. I control the source (what a pretentious
phrasing, lol).

Detailed documentation about individual tool might be found in bin/README.md

## lib

NOT in the PATH

Used my `bin`, auxillary library routines.

## xbin 

In the PATH

For 3rd party tools, unless explicitly unmasked in its .gitignore, all files
are ignored by Git. So this is where we put temporary other tools
