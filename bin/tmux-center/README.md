# Goals

I want to manage multiple remotes in multiple regions: North America,
South Asia and Europe. There are several VPS with premium link to my
location while the rest are poorly connected to me.

To optimize experience, the premium hosts are used as the managing node (*hub*) for other hosts in their regions. In those *hub*s, each node is a window and the status line is at the top with the same style as normal windows.

My own node serves as the (*center*). The status line holds windows for
each *hub*. To distinguish with them, I need different color schemes and
prefix keys.
